# Project Goals
The purpose of this website was to give tech lovers a place to share posts about their tech and aesthetic looking pictures of their tech setups.
Along with this the agenda was to build a community where like minded tech enthusiats can come togther to discuss and share their favourite tech.

The application was built on HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Bootstrap and Django REST Framework.

## UX

### User Stories and Agile

Notion was used to manage User stories and bugs.
I decided to structure my user stories slightly diffrent as it worked best for me in the following way. I constructed project goals and mapped a single user story per project goal. I also decided to use Notion as I felt it would allow me to have a better level of flexability.

I split it into the following sections: Planning, In progress,cancelled, done, future features and bugs.

I was able to successfully manage my project using Agile without any issues.

Can find my Notion Project management here: [Cick Here](https://time-periodical-439.notion.site/2c93fe949a724558bce2a02392ce1c2e?v=fa2256167a4943d1b93b84758142e771).

### Structure

The goal of the site structure is to be basic, clean and simple. The structure should be easy to navigate.

Site Structure:

    2. Sign up page
    3. Sign in page
    4. Add post or gallery post form pages
    5. Feed page to only show posts for users your following only
    6. Gallery post page
    7. Saved posts page
    8. Gallery post/post page(when you click on a post or gallery post)
    9. Contact page
    10. Profile page
    Nav bar is shown on all pages.


## Wireframes

# Testing

## Functionality and Compatibility Testing
For functionality testing I tested my website in all diffrent sizes in chrome, firefox and safari.
My project looked great on all browsers and were responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop. There was room for improvement but the responsiveness was still functional.
Much testing was done using an Iphone 13 pro, iPad pro and Macbook Pro 13". This ensured I knew what impact my changes were continously making. 

## Code Validator Testing

## HTML:


I used the following Html validator to validate my project. I validated all template pages such as home, posts, profiles,contact and signup forms. 
It was validated via: https://validator.w3.org/
![html-home](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_home.png)
![html-posts](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_posts.png)
![html-profile](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_profile.png)
![html-createposts](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_createposts.png)
![html-contact](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_contact.png)
![html-signup](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/html/Html_val_signup.png)



## CSS:


I used the following css validator to validate my project. I validated all template pages such as home, posts, profiles,contact and signup forms.  

It was validated via: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

![css-home](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_home.png)
![css-posts](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_posts.png)
![css-profile](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_profiles.png)
![css-createposts](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_createposts.png)
![css-contact](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_contact.png)
![css-signup](src/assets/readme/testing/validation/css/css_val_signup.png)


## ESLINT:

There were 5 errors in eslint which were unable to be validated by ESLINT: The error was: "PASS CHILDREN AS PROPS. INSTEAD, NEST CHILDREN BETWEEN THE OPENING AND CLOSING TAGS"
This error was also shown in the Walkthrough project Moments. After much research there was no fix. I belive the issue doesn't effect the way in whicht he project works and presents no real issue apart from react best practice. Hence I added ignore rules for the lines showing the errors:

The pages effected are: 
ProfilePage.js
PostsPage.js
Postpage.js
GalleryPostsPage.js
GalleryPostPage.js

These are ignored and the following line is added to each of these pages so the error isn't presented. 
/*eslint-disable*/

Here is an example of the error presented:
![eslint-error](src/assets/readme/testing/eslint_error.png)



## SEO Testing
Below are screenshots taken from the chrome dev tools lighthouse function to evaluate SEO of the website. Looks like all looks fine apart from performance which I was unable to fix. However it will be added to future features to speed up site.
I used the following templates to text every part fo the site.

Potential fix: Would need more research. 

3. Issue: Downvotes button allignment is slightly higher then upvotes.
Potential fix: Would need more research.
